However, I can guide you through the process of booking leave. \n\nTo request time off, you can log in to the HR system and submit a request at least two weeks in advance. You will need to obtain approval from your line manager, and it's also a good idea to coordinate with your team members to ensure that your absence does not negatively impact ongoing projects. \n\nIf you need further assistance with the HR system, please let me know and I can create a Zendesk ticket for you or direct you to the appropriate HR personnel.",
